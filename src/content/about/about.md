I am a full-stack developer with a specialization in React.js & Node.js .
With 3 years of experience under my belt (since 01/2020), I have also worked with other frameworks such as Next.js,
Nest.js, and .Net Core.
In addition to my front-end skills, I also have expertise in using Flutter to build cross-platform mobile applications.
Although I am comfortable working across the stack, my primary focus is on front-end development. I am passionate
about creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly interfaces that not only meet but exceed client expectations.
I'm always eager to take on new challenges, learn new technologies, and collaborate with other professionals in the field.
